First you will want to ensure you have raspbian on your memory card.

Specifically follow the instructions for NOOBS installation here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md

Once raspbian is installed open the terminal and run these commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip
sudo pip install --upgrade distribute
sudo pip install ipython
sudo pip install --upgrade RPi.GPIO

Your RPi is now ready for python development.
