## 1 - What is Scale for Good?
Scale for Good is an open-source IoT project that aims to reduce the friction between donation weighing and inventory management for nonprofit organizations.
It is not uncommon for food banks to document donation weights by hand and insert them manually into their database system. This method is both time consuming and error prone. Scale for Good aims to solve this problem by connecting the scale directly to the user's phone. The phone app allows for users to check, edit and send donation data to their cloud database making the whole process a whole lot easier.
